                <h1 id="learning-to-understand-git">Learning to understand git</h1>
<p>Understanding version control and Git was not easy to learn for me. It took me longer than it should have. Thankfully I was fortunate to have several people willing to help and explain everything to me. The problem was me. I couldn't relate what I was told to anything I already understood. That made it relaly difficult to make progress. I understood the <em>words</em> that were used as part of the explanation but missed the underlying <em>meaning</em>. I was pointed towards <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">git documentation</a> and started reading. Again I read the words but missed the meaning. Despite lack of progress and frustration I continued on, this time searching out tutorials.</p>
<p>One that really helped had a <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">visual component</a>. The breadcrumbing introduction it had along with seeing HEAD move as a commit occured made everything very understandable. After completing the tutorial I created a throwaway repository to test and further my understanding. It was at this point that a lot of what I read previously and read started to make sense.</p>
<h2 id="initializing-the-throwaway-learning-repo">Initializing the throwaway-learning repo</h2>
<p>I created a new directory, started Git Bash on that directory, then ran <code>git init</code> to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init">initialize</a> or start the repo.<br />
<img alt="Initializing the repo" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/01_Initialized_the_repo.png" title="Create directories via Command Line Interface (CLI) with `mkdir DirectoryName`" /></p>
<h2 id="adding-files">Adding files</h2>
<p>Next I added text files manually to the directory. I confirmed that these were seen with <code>git status</code> to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status">display the changes made</a>.<br />
<img alt="Newly created files are seen" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/02_Newly_created_files_are_seen.png" title="Creating empty files with `touch FileName.txt` or `echo &quot;File content&quot; > FileName.txt`" /></p>
<p>Then, as I did previously in the tutorials, I used the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">add command</a> via <code>git add</code> to add the files to the index <code>git add First\ file.txt</code>. <br />
<strong><em>***Note - Autocompletion:</em></strong> If you type <code>git add Fir|</code> leaving the cursor blinking at <code>|</code> you can autocomplete the file name with Tab.<br />
<strong><em>***Note - Escape character:</em></strong> The <code>\</code> (backslash) is an escape character for the character that follows it, the <code></code> &nbsp;(space) character. Files with spaces in their names need the spaces to either be escaped in this manner or otherwise enclosed in quotes <code>'</code> (single quote) or <code>"</code> (double quote). The following are also valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add 'First file.txt'</code></li>
<li><code>git add "First file.txt"</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Adding the first file to the index" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/03_Adding_the_first_file_to_the_index.png" /></p>
<p>Adding files this way places them in the index, a preparation-area. It is a file of interest but isn't yet a part of the repo. Commonly called either staging-area or index, I use them interchangeably. The explicit <code>git add</code> step gives you the control to add only the files you want the repo.</p>
<p>Add the other files executing <code>git add .</code> where the <code>.</code> (period) indicates you want to add the new files. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add/16162511">Relevant StackOverflow question for adding files</a>.<br />
<img alt="Add remaining files to the index" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/04_Add_remaining_files_to_the_index.png" /></p>
<h2 id="committing-to-the-repo">Committing to the repo</h2>
<p>Now that the three files are in the staging area, add them to the repo via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit">git commit</a>. Execute <code>git commit -m "Initial commit"</code> where the <code>-m</code> is a flag/indicator that the following string <code>"Initial commit"</code> is the commit-message/descriptive-reason-it-was-added.<br />
<img alt="Initial files commited to the repo" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/05_Initial_files_committed_to_the_repo.png" /></p>
<h2 id="detecting-differences">Detecting differences</h2>
<p>Â¿Ok now what? Time to see at what git can do for you. Delete one of the files. Execute <code>git status</code> and you'll see that it has been deleted. The file committed to the repository so from this point on it is tracked. Any differences in it, even a single character, will be brought to your attention as a change.<br />
<img alt="Deleted file identified by git" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/06_Deleted_file_identified_by_git.png" /></p>
<h2 id="restoring-from-the-repo">Restoring from the repo</h2>
<p><strong><em>Suggestion:</em></strong> Before continuing I suggest navigating to the directory you're working in to have it visible. Seeing the next command executed solidified the concept.</p>
<p>Because the file was committed to the repo you can restore it. Execute <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore">git restore</a> with <code>git restore Second\ file.txt</code> to bring the file from the repo back into the directory.</p>
<p>Now that I saw this in action I continued by creating two new files and editting those already existing.<br />
<img alt="New and edited files" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/07_New_and_edited_files.png" /></p>
<p>I restored one file with <code>git restore First\ file.txt</code>, and visually inspected it with a text editor confirming the changes weren't there. Executing <code>git status</code> confirmed no changes were detected. It was <code>restore</code>d back to the same state as when it was added to the repo.</p>
<p>Once again I made edits to First file.txt and saved them. Running <code>git status</code> confirmed they were there. Â¿What if I want to restore all the files? I executed <code>git restore .</code> followed by <code>git status</code> to see what changes were left. Naively I was a bit surprised to see files showing.<br />
<img alt="State after restoring all files" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/08_State_after_restoring_all_files.png" /></p>
<p>Â¿Why are those files there? They shouldn't be there... Wait. Maybe they should be. :click: that's when another git puzzle piece connected; I understood the different areas of git. "Working Directory" is just that, the directory-where-work-is-done. Mentally changing the text on the middle arrow to "Stage changes=<code>git add</code>" helped.<br />
<img alt="The git areas image" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png" /></p>
<p>Another image, git-lifecycle, from the documentation made sense as well.<br />
<img alt="Git lifecycle image" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png" /></p>
<p>When a new file is first seen it is untracked. I checked back up at the previous commands and the new files were indeed "Untracked files". After <code>git add</code> the files were in the Staged/Staging-Area, designated as "Changes to be committed".</p>
<p>My question now was Â¿how can I remove these files? I already knew I could delete them normally by right clicking and choosing delete, but this small taste of Command Line Interface (CLI) power had me hooked. I wanted more. I eventually found the command I wanted was <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean">git clean</a>.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to remove both the remaining untracked files I executed <code>git clean .</code>. As before I watched the directory while I executed the command. Nothing happened. Confused, I then saw the output "fatal: clean.requireForce...".<br />
<img alt="" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/09_Attempting_to_clean_untracked_files.png" /></p>
<p>Reading the documentation <code>-i</code> was shorthand for <code>--interactive</code> "Show what would be done and clean files interactively". Going with that I executed <code>git clean -i .</code><br />
<img alt="" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/10_Cleaning_requires_aparameters.png" /></p>
<p>The documentation for <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean#_interactive_mode">interactive mode</a> led me to executing option 1: clean.<br />
<img alt="" src="../Images/learning_to_understand_git/11_Untracked_files_cleaned_away.png" /></p>
<p>I forgot to watch the directory to see that they were removed but that didn't matter. At this point I knew I was on my way to learning to understand git.</p>
